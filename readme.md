# üçÖ Pomodoro Technique √ó Spotify üéµ

Pomodoro technique is known as a method we can gain concentration efficiently. I came up with an idea that it works more if it goes along with calm and minimal music. This app behaves just as a timer. But if you have a premium Spotify account, it also generates a nice playlist based on techno or minimal music and also works as a music player. Moreover, if you like the specific song or playlist they made, you can add them to your playlist on Spotify. Get an extraordinary concentration with this app!
